### This Is My Header
 
This is a new paragraph. All I have to do is add a new line. Oh yea, and I want this word to be **bold**.
 
Then I'll add a simple list:
 
* List Item 1
* A second.
* A third, with a [blah](img/1.JPG)

But we can also test like this  

![blah](img/1.JPG =250x250)

pretty cool
